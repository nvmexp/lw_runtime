The files in lwperf come from the devtools official build
of LOP.  The official builds can be found on the FTP
server (see https://wiki.lwpu.com/odin/index.php/Odin_workplace).
Builds live in Raptor_to_Hovi/LOP/.  We need to pair the
official build with the supported DDK.

The current build is LOP/M8.26 (DDK13.1, build number is 1.6.0_21161_2354_30065083).

These files are not buildable from the HOS driver
workflow.

Ultimately llgd-replay is linked to the nss/nso files.
These files can be hand built in the devtools tree by
building perfworks using a HOS variant.
