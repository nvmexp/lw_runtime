<tr>
<th>Feature</th><th>Status</th><th>Milestone</th></tr>
<tr><td>Android port</td><td>Basic but complete functionality by <a href="http://www.beuc.net/">Sylvain
Beucler</a>, but there are <a href=docs/android.php#roadmap>todo
points</a></td><td>Basic functionality as is now done: 3.0. Future
enhancements: 3.0 or later.</td></tr>

<tr><td>BlackBerry 10 port</td><td>Basic but complete functionality
by <a href="https://github.com/rcmaniac25">Vinnie Simonetti</a>.</td><td>Basic functionality as is now done: 3.0. Future
enhancements: 3.0 or later.</td></tr>

<tr><td>10bit display formats</td><td>GLUT supports that but FreeGLUT
lwrrently does not. Unfinished effort to implement <a
href="https://github.com/dcnieho/FreeGLUT/tree/feature_30bit_framebuffer">here</a>.</td><td>3.0
or later.</td></tr>

<tr><td>GL2+ and GLES 1/2 clean API for geometry</td><td>Done for all (geometry like
lwbe, cone, etc, as well as the teapot and other parts of the
teaset)</td><td>3.0</td></tr>

<tr><td>GL2+ and GLES 1/2 clean API for fonts and menus</td><td>For
stroke fonts, we can use a similar approach as for the shapes, should
thus be straightforward. For the bitmap fonts, this is more complex.
John T suggested "using a glyph atlas texture with GL_STREAM_DRAW VBOs",
which would get us somewhere. Code could be ripped from his </a
href="http://nuclear.mutantstargoat.com/sw/libdrawtext/">libdrawtext
library</a></td><td>The sooner the better, but will have to wait for
asap after 3.0.</td></tr>

<tr><td>At runtime loading of OpenGL, OpenGL ES1 or OpenGL ES2 libraries,
like SDL.</td><td>Lwrrently CMake variables define at compile time which
of these three the library will be compiled against. No work has been
done on moving this to an at-runtime API.</td><td>Having this in 3.0
would be nice, but not essential.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Code reorganized such that platform-specific and display
server-specific code are decoupled</td><td>Done, thanks John Fay! This
already led to a port to Android and support for GLES 1/2 on X11
(thanks Sylvain for both!), and paves the way for implementing native
OSX and Wayland support</td><td>3.0</td></tr>

<tr><td>Position callback</td><td>Done: we now have a position callback
to notify the client when the position of the window
changed.</td><td>3.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>

<tr><td>Carbon/Cocoa port</td><td>Not started. As Carbon is legacy, one
might want to port to Cocoa first or even forget about Carbon all
together.</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>

<tr><td>Wayland port</td><td>Not started.</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>

<tr><td>Unicode support</td><td>Not started, we'd need to discuss this
carefully on the mailing list first to minimize impact on the
API.</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>

<tr><td>Complete glutInitDisplayString support</td><td>FreeGLUT now only
partially supports glutInitDisplayString, any spec (comparator and
value) after each token are ignored. This is a significant way in which
FreeGLUT is not compatible with GLUT. Could be a nice project for
someone who want to become familiar with the intricacies of requesting
specific display formats on at least one of the various window servers
(Windows, X11 and Android/BlackBerry 10/EGL at the
moment).</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>
