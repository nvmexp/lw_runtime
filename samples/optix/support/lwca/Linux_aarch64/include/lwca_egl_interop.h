 * \brief Registers an EGL image
 *
 * Registers the EGLImageKHR specified by \p image for access by
 * LWCA. A handle to the registered object is returned as \p pLwdaResource.
 * Additional Mapping/Unmapping is not required for the registered resource and
 * ::lwdaGraphicsResourceGetMappedEglFrame can be directly called on the \p pLwdaResource.
 *
 * The application will be responsible for synchronizing access to shared objects.
 * The application must ensure that any pending operation which access the objects have completed
 * before passing control to LWCA. This may be accomplished by issuing and waiting for
 * glFinish command on all GLcontexts (for OpenGL and likewise for other APIs).
 * The application will be also responsible for ensuring that any pending operation on the
 * registered LWCA resource has completed prior to exelwting subsequent commands in other APIs
 * accesing the same memory objects.
 * This can be accomplished by calling lwCtxSynchronize or lwEventSynchronize (preferably).
 *
 * The surface's intended usage is specified using \p flags, as follows:
 *
 * - ::lwdaGraphicsRegisterFlagsNone: Specifies no hints about how this
 *   resource will be used. It is therefore assumed that this resource will be
 *   read from and written to by LWCA. This is the default value.
 * - ::lwdaGraphicsRegisterFlagsReadOnly: Specifies that LWCA
 *   will not write to this resource.
 * - ::lwdaGraphicsRegisterFlagsWriteDiscard: Specifies that
 *   LWCA will not read from this resource and will write over the
 *   entire contents of the resource, so none of the data previously
 *   stored in the resource will be preserved.
 *
 * The EGLImageKHR is an object which can be used to create EGLImage target resource. It is defined as a void pointer.
 * typedef void* EGLImageKHR
 *
 * \param pLwdaResource   - Pointer to the returned object handle
 * \param image           - An EGLImageKHR image which can be used to create target resource.
 * \param flags           - Map flags
