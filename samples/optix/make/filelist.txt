# Install OptiX as liblwoptix.so.<version> with a symlink named liblwoptix.so.1
# pointing to it.
#
# This isn't strictly necessary, but lwpu-installer has a special case for
# libraries ending in ".so.1" that expects them to be listed in the ldd output
# for the rtld test. This test does not depend on liblwoptix.so.1, so installing
# this library directly as liblwoptix.so.1 causes the runtime configuration
# consistency check to fail.
