This folder contains example BPF programs for use with the DPDK bpf
library. To get details of each program and how to compile it, see
the header on the '.c' file itself.

Once compiled, these example programs can be loaded into `testpmd`
for exelwtion on a packet stream. See `bpf-load` and `bpf-unload`
commands dolwmented in the `Testpmd Application User Guide` for
details on how to do so.
