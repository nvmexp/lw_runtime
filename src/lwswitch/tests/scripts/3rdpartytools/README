README for 3rd Party Tools:

devcon.exe:
                DevCon (Devcon.exe), the Microsoft Device Console, is a command-line
                tool that displays detailed information about devices on computers
                running Windows. DevCon can be used to enable, disable, install,
                configure, and remove devices. In our case of LWSwitch SRT, it
                is used to enable, disable and restart LWSwitch devices so that
                the device re-initialises so the interrupts are re-enabled. This
                is required as lwpu-smi doesn't support LWSwitch device reset
                on Windows.

                OS Supported:
                    DevCon runs on Microsoft Windows 2000 and later versions of
                    Windows.
