The Google Test pre-built libraries under lib directory is built with the
source code at //sw/tools/sdk/gtest/1.8.0/...@21449185.

P4 path //sw/tools/sdk/gtest/1.8.0/... is not added to all builds, it will
break GVS if including header files from this P4 path. As a WAR,  we copy
the header files from //sw/tools/sdk/gtest/1.8.0/include here.

Once P4 path is added, we will remove the 'include' directly and use the
ones on P4.

#Please make sure to sync //sw/tools/sdk/gtest/1.8.0/... on Perforce.
