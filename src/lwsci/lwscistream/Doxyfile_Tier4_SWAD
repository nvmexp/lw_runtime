# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

# README
#
#- Added Doxyfile_Tier4_SWAD for colwerting doxygen comments in XML that
#  will be synced to Tier4 SWAD. Input to this doxygen config is public header
#  files + lwscistream_tier4_swad_jamaIDs.txt + unit header files.
#
#- The interface specification of inter-unit interface in the Tier-4 SWAD should
#  only explain the externally-visible behavior of the interface to other units.
#  The interface specification in the SWUD should explain the design details, it
#  can also refer to the private interfaces / datatypes which will be dolwmented
#  as part of SWUD. So we split-up the doxygen comments as follows:
#  - Document externally visible behavior, arguments, return values in the unit
#    header file and add implements tag of the Tier4 SWAD item to it.
#  - Document design details to the source file and add implements tag of the
#    SWUD item to it.
#  - But when doxygen combines both it will actually have two implements tag
#    so both the Tier-4 SWAD and SWUD items will be updated with the complete
#    description. To avoid that we can use the CONDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION feature
#    of doxygen. We can use the "T4_SWAD" conditional variable for the implements
#    tag for Tier4 SWAD and "T4_SWUD" conditional variable for the implements
#    tag for SWUD. These conditional variables are enabled in the corresponding
#    Doxyfiles.
#  - For the header only units, we can comment the design specific details
#    with the "TIER4_SWUD" conditional variable and implements tags for both
#    T4 SWAD and SWUD will be conditionally ebnabled based on the tier.
#  - For simple interfaces (like some get(), set() accessor functions) for
#    which the content will be the same for Tier-4 SWAD and SWUD, we can add
#    implements tags for both Tier4 SWAD and SWUD items without any conditions.

# Project related configuration options

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "LwSciStream"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is included in
# the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55 pixels
# and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy the logo
# to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = .

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        =

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines.

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be

# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any

# Configuration options related to the input files

# directory for generating the xml output for DPJF tool. So
