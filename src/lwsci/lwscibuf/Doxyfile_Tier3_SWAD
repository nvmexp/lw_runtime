# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in

# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.

#  README
#
#- The use-case for generating JAMA content is that, we need to sync
#  description for interfaces in public header file to Tier-3 SWAD. We also need
#  to sync description for interfaces in public header files + design details
#  (which will be added as part of unit headers) to Tier-4 SWUD.
#
#- This problem is solved as below:
#- Added lwscibuf_tier3_swad_jamaIDs.txt file which contains JAMA IDs that need
#  to be associated with public interfaces that are
#  going to be synced to Tier-3 SWAD using DPJF. JAMA IDs should NOT be added
#  directly in public header files but rather should be added in
#  lwscibuf_tier3_swad_jamaIDs.txt for anything that needs to be synced in SWAD and
#  SWUD.
#  Right now, interfaces (APIs) and blanket statements fall in this category
#  and thus, SWAD JAMA IDs for them need to be added under this file.
#- Added Doxyfile_Tier3_SWAD for colwerting doxygen comments to XML that
#  will be synced to SWAD. Input to this doxygen config is public header
#  files (lwscibuf.h/lwscibuf_internal.h) and lwscibuf_tier3_swad_jamaIDs.txt.
#  Using this doxygen config, content in public header file gets associated
#  with JAMA ID corresponding to Tier-3 SWAD item and can be synced to JAMA.

# Project related configuration options

# The included config file is searched in the current working directory.
# You can also specify a list of directories that should be searched before
# looking in the current working directory.

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "LwSciBuf"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         =

# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

PROJECT_BRIEF          =

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is included in
# the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not exceed 55 pixels
# and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels. Doxygen will copy the logo
# to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           =

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = .

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES doxygen will prepend the full path
# before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set to NO the
# shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used
# The default value is: YES.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = YES

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        =

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    =

# This tag can be used to specify a number of aliases that act as commands in
# the documentation. An alias has the form:
# name=value
# For example adding
# "sideeffect=@par Side Effects:\n"
# will allow you to put the command \sideeffect (or @sideeffect) in the
# documentation, which will result in a user-defined paragraph with heading
# "Side Effects:". You can put \n's in the value part of an alias to insert
# newlines.

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = NO

# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.
# The default value is: NO.

# Build related configuration options

# If this flag is set to YES, the members of anonymous namespaces will be
# extracted and appear in the documentation as a namespace called
# 'anonymous_namespace{file}', where file will be replaced with the base name of
# the file that contains the anonymous namespace. By default anonymous namespace
# are hidden.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_ANON_NSPACES   = NO

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, doxygen will hide any
# documentation blocks found inside the body of a function. If set to NO these
# blocks will be appended to the function's detailed documentation block.
# The default value is: NO.

HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS      = NO

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation that is typed after a
# \internal command is included. If the tag is set to NO then the documentation
# will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# dolwmented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces.
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

# Do not put .c paths here. It causes repeated descriptions.
INPUT += ../inc/public/lwscibuf.h ../inc/internal/lwscibuf_internal.h

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should be
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.
#
# Note that relative paths are relative to the directory from which doxygen is
# run.

EXCLUDE                =

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# EXCLUDE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard patterns to exclude
# certain files from those directories.
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories for example use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_PATTERNS       =

# The EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS tag can be used to specify one or more symbol names
# (namespaces, classes, functions, etc.) that should be excluded from the
# output. The symbol name can be a fully qualified name, a word, or if the
# wildcard * is used, a substring. Examples: ANamespace, AClass,
# AClass::ANamespace, ANamespace::*Test
#
# Note that the wildcards are matched against the file with absolute path, so to
# exclude all test directories use the pattern */test/*

EXCLUDE_SYMBOLS        =

# The RELWRSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
