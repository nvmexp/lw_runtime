SMLWDA DESIGN DOCUMENT
This document describes the design and use of the smlwda BTL.

BACKGROUND
The smlwda btl is a copy of the sm btl but with some additional features.
The main extra feature is the ability to make use of the LWCA IPC APIs to
quickly move GPU buffers from one GPU to another.  Without this support,
the GPU buffers would all be moved into and then out of host memory.

GENERAL DESIGN

The general design makes use of the large message RDMA RGET support in the
OB1 PML.  However, there are some interesting choices to make use of it.
First, we disable any large message RDMA support in the BTL for host
messages.  This is done because we need to use the mca_btl_smlwda_get() for
the GPU buffers.  This is also done because the upper layers expect there
to be a single mpool but we need one for the GPU memory and one for the
host memory.  Since the advantages of using RDMA with host memory is
unclear, we disabled it.  This means no KNEM or CMA support built in to the
smlwda BTL.

Also note that we give the smlwda BTL a higher rank than the sm BTL.  This
means it will always be selected even if we are doing host only data
transfers.  The smlwda BTL is not built if it is not requested via the
--with-lwca flag to the configure line.

Secondly, the smlwda does not make use of the traditional method of
enabling RDMA operations.  The traditional method checks for the existence
of an RDMA btl hanging off the endpoint.  The smlwda works in conjunction
with the OB1 PML and uses flags that it sends in the BML layer.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
LWCA IPC is not necessarily supported by all GPUs on a node.  In NUMA
nodes, LWCA IPC may only work between GPUs that are not connected
over the IOH.  In addition, we want to check for LWCA IPC support lazily,
when the first GPU access oclwrs, rather than during MPI_Init() time.
This complicates the design.

INITIALIZATION
When the smlwda BTL initializes, it starts with no support for LWCA IPC.
Upon the first access of a GPU buffer, the smlwda checks which GPU device
it has and sends that to the remote side using a smlwda specific control
message.  The other rank receives the message, and checks to see if there
is LWCA IPC support between the two GPUs via a call to
lwDeviceCanAccessPeer().  If it is true, then the smlwda BTL piggy backs on
the PML error handler callback to make a call into the PML and let it know
to enable LWCA IPC. We created a new flag so that the error handler does
the right thing.  Large message RDMA is enabled by setting a flag in the
bml->btl_flags field.  Control returns to the smlwda BTL where a reply
message is sent so the sending side can set its flag.

At that point, the PML layer starts using the large message RDMA support
in the smlwda BTL.  This is done in some special LWCA code in the PML layer.

ESTABLISHING LWCA IPC SUPPORT
A check has been added into both the send and sendi path in the smlwda btl
that checks to see if it should send a request for LWCA IPC setup message.

    /* Initiate setting up LWCA IPC support. */
    if (mca_common_lwda_enabled && (IPC_INIT == endpoint->ipcstatus)) {
        mca_btl_smlwda_send_lwda_ipc_request(btl, endpoint);
    }

The first check is to see if the LWCA environment has been initialized.  If
not, then presumably we are not sending any GPU buffers yet and there is
nothing to be done.  If we are initialized, then check the status of the
LWCA IPC endpoint.  If it is in the IPC_INIT stage, then call the function
to send of a control message to the endpoint.

On the receiving side, we first check to see if we are initialized.  If
not, then send a message back to the sender saying we are not initialized.
This will cause the sender to reset its state to IPC_INIT so it can try
again on the next send.

I considered putting the receiving side into a new state like IPC_NOTREADY,
and then when it switches to ready, to then sending the ACK to the sender.
The problem with this is that we would need to do these checks during the
progress loop which adds some extra overhead as we would have to check all
endpoints to see if they were ready.

Note that any rank can initiate the setup of LWCA IPC.  It is triggered by
whichever side does a send or sendi call of a GPU buffer.

I have the sender attempt 5 times to set up the connection.  After that, we
give up.  Note that I do not expect many scenarios where the sender has to
resend.  It could happen in a race condition where one rank has initialized
its LWCA environment but the other side has not.

There are several states the connections can go through.

IPC_INIT   - nothing has happened
IPC_SENT   - message has been sent to other side
IPC_ACKING - Received request and figuring out what to send back
IPC_ACKED  - IPC ACK sent
IPC_OK     - IPC ACK received back
IPC_BAD    - Something went wrong, so marking as no IPC support

NOTE ABOUT LWCA IPC AND MEMORY POOLS
The LWCA IPC support works in the following way.  A sender makes a call to
lwIpcGetMemHandle() and gets a memory handle for its local memory.  The
sender then sends that handle to receiving side.  The receiver calls
lwIpcOpenMemHandle() using that handle and gets back an address to the
remote memory.  The receiver then calls lwMemcpyAsync() to initiate a
remote read of the GPU data.

The receiver maintains a cache of remote memory that it has handles open on.
This is because a call to lwIpcOpenMemHandle() can be very expensive (90usec) so
we want to avoid it when we can.  The cache of remote memory is kept in a memory
pool that is associated with each endpoint.  Note that we do not cache the local
memory handles because getting them is very cheap and there is no need.
