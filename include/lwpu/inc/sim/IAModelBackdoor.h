/// Please, please, please increment the version number with each change
/// We couldn't find an automatic way for this to happen.
/// Version 6: Added 2 GetClassID() functions on IAModelToResman.
/// Version 7: Added dynamic contextDMAs
/// Version 8: Added errorNotifierContextDMA in the channel creation functions
/// Version 9: Added command line args on the setup() function
/// Version 10: Broken the backdoor interface into a common part, and then mods/SoftAmodel 
///             specific parts
/// Version 11: Added a new function for mods to ask the amodel to do additional verification
///             It's needed for FermiPerfsim to be able to do it's own perf verification and 
///             have trace_3d report it properly in addition to the image CRC checking.
/// Version 12: Added a new function for mods to ask the amodel for the character to be appended
///             on CRC keys. 'a' for amodel, or 'p' for perfsim.
/// Version 13: Added ResourceType and AllocAttribs on amodel_mapping_info which is used by SoftAmodel/DirectAModel
///
/// Version 13: Added GetModelIdentifierString() which mods would want soon, but haven't bumped up the version 
///             to reduce disruption, since mods doesn't check the version, and drivers don't use this part of the interface...
/// Version 13: Removed GetModelIdentifier() which mods now stopped using but haven't bumped up the version 
///             to reduce disruption, since mods doesn't check the version, and drivers don't use this part of the interface...

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Summary of interfaces defined in this file
// ------------------------------------------
// The initial intention was that there is a single interafce which both mods 
// and RM/SoftAmodel will use. The evolutation of the hookups cause these to 
// actually have very little overlap, so at some point we split into 2 separate
// interfaces so that changes in one would not affect the other.
// There is also an interface that is used by amodel to call back into the 
// RM/SoftAmodel code, which is not used by mods.
// - IAModelBackdoorSoftAmodel - For SoftAmodel to call into amodel
// - IAModelBackdoor - For mods to call into amodel.
// - IAModelBackdoorCommon - Shared functions between the 2 above.
// - IAModelToResman - Callback for amodel into SoftAmodel.
